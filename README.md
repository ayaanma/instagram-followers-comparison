# Instagram Followers & Following Organization.

This is a Python script that will alphabetically organize `followers_1.html` and `following.html` files when requesting Instagram data. Will produce respective `.txt` files. 
Allows the user to easily compare the two files and view who they follow that doesn't follow them back and vice versa.

Place this file in the same folder as these files are in order to run.
